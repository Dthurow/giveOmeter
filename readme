Have multiple "climber" characters with their own score and name. Once that is set in the code, start the game. 

---------------------
Example start:

python ./main.py

---------------------

Once it's started, use the left and right arrow to focus on a character, use up and down to increment or decrement that climber's score, then press enter to update the location of the climbers. 

Once one climber hits the winning score, The winners name appears on the screen in big letters.


---------------------

BASIC CODE SET UP

main.py -- shockingly, main file with main game loop
eventHandling.py -- reads input from wherever, returns list of events that have happened since it was last called
display.py -- code to display the climber, aka sprites, current score, climber names
GlobalConstants.py -- what it says on the tin
CharacterClasses.py -- The main classes for the game: Climber, Counter, GameState
SpriteImages Folder -- Where the sprites are stored


---------------------

PLANNED UPDATES (in no particular order)

With the eventHandling abstracted out, it can potentially be updated to use a more interesting input, such as a joystick/button combo.

Add animation for the climber sprites when they move

Add background image to the game

Abstract out settings for an individual game into a separate file, have the code read in the settings before starting (e.g. change start to "python ./main.py setting.config")

Add background music
